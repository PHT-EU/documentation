# Deployment guide

## Introduction
The deployment guide is intended for people, who want to deploy parts of the PHT infrastructure.
To be more specific, we will explain how to set up a local station, and how to set up a central
App and API.

**Note:** The setup for the local station is necessary for the administrator role (see [here](/guide/deployment/station-registration)).

## Overview
For setting up either a local station or the central App/API the following instructions are prepared:

**``Station``**
- [registration](/guide/deployment/station-registration)
- [installation](/guide/deployment/station-installation)
- optional [troubleshooting](/guide/deployment/station-troubleshooting)

**`Central`**
