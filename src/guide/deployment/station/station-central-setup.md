## Prerequisites
- Access to a PHT Central instance (if you would like to setup a PHT Central instance, please refer to the 
    [PHT Central Deployment Guide](/guide/deployment/central/central-introduction))
- Your user need the `station_authority` role to create new stations

## Setup

- Follow the instructions found [here](/guide/user/station/central_ui) to setup a new station
- Note down the credentials for the automatically created robot account to use them in the next step
::: warning Warning
