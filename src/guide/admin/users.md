In order to manage your identity-providers, stations, ... you need to get an organization. Please contact us,
such we can provide you a realm in which you can manage all your stations, users and identity providers.

Currently normal realm users cannot register into the PHT by themselves. They must be registered and
added by a realm administrator. While doing so, the admin may give roles to a specific user.

1. Within the admin area (top left), you need to select **Users** within the left navigation.
