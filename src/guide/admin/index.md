# Administrator guide

## Introduction
This guide is addressed at realm/station administrators. By contacting the developer team an
initial realm will be assigned to the administrator.

The administrator will have full permissions for their realm acting as the base for all future
endeavours related to their organization for the PHT. Be it creating other realms, user accounts,
roles, or setting up stations for the PHT train pipeline.
The administrator will oversee all of those actions within their realm.

## Overview
Administrators have the following tasks in the PHT, either in the central App or in their
local Station setup:

**``Central``**
- [realm-](/guide/admin/realms), [identity provider-](/guide/admin/identity-providers), [robot-](/guide/admin/robots), [user-](/guide/admin/users) & [role-management](/guide/admin/roles)
