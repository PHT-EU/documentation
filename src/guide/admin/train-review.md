# Train Review
As a station administrator, you have a crucial role in trains: If your station was part of an approved proposal, the
analyst who set it up can create trains with your station. Before a valid train is built, it requires approval.
Here, you may review the analysis code and see whether your provided station data will be used according to the study
protocol. If it is, approve the train. If it is not, you may reject the train, effectively blocking its execution on
your site. If you do so, we encourage you to inform the data analyst of the reason so they can revise it. After approval
or rejection of each site, the train is built.

To review trains, follow these steps:
1. Within the home area (top left), you need to select **Trains** in the left navigation, and then the Option
   **Incoming** to its right.
2. Here, you can view all approved, rejected, as well as trains awaiting either (Optional: Use the search bar at the
   top).

4. **Approve** incoming trains by clicking the gray triple-bar button on the right of the train and then clicking the
   green approve button in the small popup.
5. **Reject** incoming trains by clicking the gray triple-bar button on the right of the train and then clicking the
   red reject button in the small popup.
