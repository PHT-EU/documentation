# Analyst Introduction
As an Analyst, you will interact with two of the components of the PHT. The Central services, where you can create [Trains](/guide/introduction/trains.md) and see their status,
and the [Desktop APP](#desktop-app), where you can create your keys, sign your trains, and decrypt the results of your train. 
In this guide, we will show you step-by-step how to install the desktop app and create your user in the central instance; Then, we will show you how to make your first train and download the results.   
# Desktop App

The PHT Desktop App is the offline tool of the User Interface. It can sign hashes locally during the submission process of a train.
After successful execution, it is used to decrypt downloaded results and key management.  

## Installation

You can download the newest release of the Desktop APP for Windows, Linux, or Mac from [GitHub](https://github.com/PHT-Medic/desktop-app/releases/latest) and
install the software on your local machine.

## Create Keys
The first thing we need from the Desktop APP is an *RSA-key-pair*. For this, follow these steps.

1. Start the application.
2. From the Homepage click on **Settings** on the left hand side.

3. Click on the **KeyPair**-button of the RSA box.

4. Specify the directory where the keys should be saved.
5. Specify the filename of the private and the public key on the right side.
6. Select a passphrase for your private key. (If you press enter, an empty passphrase will be used)
7. Click on the **Generate**-button.

### Load Keys
If you already have made a key-pair, you can load them into the Desktop APP. For this, follow these steps.

1. Start the application.
2. From the Homepage click on **Settings** on the left hand side.
3. Click on the **KeyPair**-button of the RSA box.
4. Specify the directory where the keys are saved.
5. Specify the Passphrase for the key.
6. Click on the **Load**-button.

### Homomorphic Keys
If you want to create a train that uses Homomorphic encryption, you will have to create a *homomorphic key-pair*; this is done similarly.
Only select the **Homomorphic**-button in step 3.
