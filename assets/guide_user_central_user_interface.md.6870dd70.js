Private data is really sensitive and needs to be handled accordingly. So we give a Risk, so each station can have a clue about what kind of data will be used during the stopover of the train. For this we have three stages:</p><ul><li>Low risk (<em>green</em>): The train won&#39;t use any personal related data, such as calculation about all Loinc-Codes of Observation-Resources in a FHIR-Server.</li><li>Mid risk (<em>yellow</em>): The train will use only one or quite few personal information of a patient such as the gender or the age. One param will not be harmful at all, but should still be mentioned when used during the process.</li><li>High (<em>red</em>): The train in general will perform some calculations / analysis on private data where it can be possible that private information can be figured out about a single person. This can occur when the calculations will be performed on only a few participants with many private data about them. Overall this should not be an issue, when the FHIR-Servers provide enough privacy preserving measurements such as pseudonymization or anonymization.</li></ul><h3 id="accepting-rejecting-an-incoming-proposal" tabindex="-1">Accepting/Rejecting an incoming proposal <a class="header-anchor" href="#accepting-rejecting-an-incoming-proposal" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>Within the incoming section of each station, a station authority can independently decide to comment, approve or reject a study proposal for analysis.
